# Nuclear and Frebenius Norm Regularization for Multi-Source Domain Generalization

This repository contains one attempt to verify the effectiveness of Nuclear norm and Frobenius norm regularizations on representations for achieving robustness across multiple multi-source datasets. The work is conducted under the DomainBed framework.

## Overview

- **Objective**: Enhance domain generalization
- **Method**: Apply Nuclear and Frobenius norm regularizations on representations
- **Framework**: DomainBed
- **Inspiration**: Elastic-Net regularization, which uses L1 and L2 regularization
- **Status**: One of multiple attempts in this research direction

## Approach

The method is inspired by Elastic-Net regularization, which utilizes both L1 and L2 norms. In this project, we extend this concept to use Nuclear norm (similar to L1) and Frobenius norm (similar to L2) for regularizing representations.

## Current Status

⚠️ **Note**: This particular implementation does not yield the expected improvements in performance.
